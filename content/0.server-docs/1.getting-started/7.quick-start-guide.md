![enter image description here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1159438141300670604/1310218502514147358/image.png?ex=67446b91&is=67431a11&hm=6ac5c040269046ac3d0e8b37e808dcacd911f311860d4af5216526bd7b864f0b&)


## Purchasing First Car

One of the most awesome extras of FDG is the variety of cars! We have a range of different dealerships in the city that either provide you brand new or second hand cars. Places such as **Premium Deluxe Motorsport (PDM)** offer you brand new cars which is your best starting point. 

![enter image description here](https://cdn.fatduckgaming.com/58157711-7228-45f6-b87c-c781f0e7ae1f_1726663594142.png)

You can get a new car for as little as $575 from PDM as well as our mechanics such as **LSC, Flywheels, Benny's and Hayes** that have second hand cars for $500,000 plus.   

Also don't forget to check **Marketplace, Twitter and pop-up car sales** for any second hand car deals. 

**PDM** does not have any active employee's but instead you go to the show room blip as seen below in the picture

![enter image description here](https://cdn.fatduckgaming.com/39480c4b-e927-4315-b8a8-eb64bd1cddc2_1725671765776.png)

You are then taken into a purchasing menu where you can find cheap cars such as the Glendale under 'Sedan' as seen below 

![enter image description here](https://cdn.fatduckgaming.com/e189b9e3-dae3-4715-a95d-211ddec7bd45_1725671956061.png)

Select the vehicle you're after by pressing enter and follow the prompts. Just remember you must have the funds available in your bank. This system does not allow you to go into a negative balance or take the cash out of your inventory. 

The same kind of system can be found at any of the Mechanics however a car is purchased via a sales assistant. If you wish to check their stock and prices of new/used cars you must request a sales assistant to help you.
  
:white_check_mark: Congrats, now you know how to purchase your first car and start your car journey in FDG!


## Where does my new car go?

Buying a new car can be exciting! But after your joyride ends, you might wonder: **Where do I store it?** Can you retrieve it the next day? What happens if it gets damaged or blown up? The answer is simple—the **safest place to store your car is in a garage.**

Most rental houses include a garage where you can safely store your vehicle. When choosing a place to live, keep an eye out for a **physical garage attached to the property.** Some smaller apartments may not come with one, so make sure to check before signing a lease!

![enter image description here](https://cdn.fatduckgaming.com/97719342-e91a-4ff2-9786-7293fb8bfbeb_1728697605128.png)

What if I Don't Own or Rent a Property Yet?

No worries! The city offers **public garages** where you can store and retrieve your car any time. These garages are marked on the map with the following icon:

![enter image description here](https://cdn.fatduckgaming.com/1bd2d63b-8ca8-4f52-ba2e-ffbe3882b8f1_1728697971910.png)

At these public garages, your vehicle will be safely stored, and **only you** will have access to your cars. Just make sure to store your car properly to avoid having it impounded!

![enter image description here](https://cdn.fatduckgaming.com/2cbf9fc4-6af0-4409-ab8d-248b0622adb1_1728698287112.png)

Keep in mind that you can only have **one instance of your vehicle active in the world at any given time**. Unfortunately, the garage's **"Tow" feature isn't magic**—if your car is stolen, lost, or destroyed somewhere in the city, the system won't allow you to spawn a duplicate. You’ll need to **find and recover the vehicle yourself**!

If your vehicle is **blown up or destroyed**, it may not be immediately available for retrieval. In some cases, you might have to wait until the **next server restart** before you can get it back.

Lastly, **parking violations** can result in your car being towed. If the **police or a mechanic** tows your vehicle, it will be sent to the **impound lot**, where you’ll need to pay a fee to recover it. So, park responsibly to avoid unnecessary trips to the impound!


## Making Money

There are a lot of different ways to make money in FDG! You can either choose the legal or illegal route however keep in mind making money illegally comes with it's risks!

Let's go through some legal ways to make money and get you started. 

There are such jobs like
- **Go Postal** 
- **Council jobs**
- **Farming** (You make money from selling the fruit & vegetables you collect)
- **Car parts** (You will need to bring your own vehicle)
- **Fishing** (You will need to by a fishing rod) How to - https://fatduckgaming.com/server-docs/activities-guides/fishing
- **Trucking** (You will need to buy your own truck from the trucking depot) How to - https://fatduckgaming.com/server-docs/activities-guides/trucking
- **Diving** (You will need to purchase a knife & put on scuba tank at the clothing store) How to - https://fatduckgaming.com/server-docs/activities-guides/diving
- **Hunting** (You will need to purchase a knife, hunting rife & bullets) How to - https://fatduckgaming.com/server-docs/activities-guides/hunting


The three jobs that don't require you to bring anything but yourself like **Go Postal**, **Farming** and **Council jobs** are the best to start with. They can be found on your map as shown in the pictures below and have multiple locations to pick up jobs on your map. 

![enter image description here](https://cdn.fatduckgaming.com/1bc7e669-83a1-4733-8ada-0ca8f4eb5976_1725676525882.png)
![enter image description here](https://cdn.fatduckgaming.com/8dc87fd8-cc12-4e0e-9828-f7d66d39e7f6_1725676583545.png)
![enter image description here](https://cdn.fatduckgaming.com/527c71d4-e49b-4e53-b696-c97ac356cf92_1725676630540.png)

There is an option of applying for player ran businesses such as mechanics and entertainment however some may require you to have in city experience beforehand rather than applying on your first day. Set yourself up properly, navigate the city and understand the rules of roleplay before starting that next journey in your FDG career. 

Once you have done that you can head over to the **Seekr App** on your phone and look through the list of jobs that interest you. Keep in mind they are organised through actual players so put some time and effort into your job application is a must to stand out from the crowd!

When you apply for a job, upon submitting the application you will see it at the top in **Your Applications**

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/kvUT7cP.png)

If you are interested in joining the **San Andreas Emergency services** or **San Andreas Police Department** you must make different characters for each of them and apply as they are 'full time' jobs. Again you will need to have some experience in city before applying as they will most likely reject you if you're fresh to the city. 

Something to keep in mind with the **SAES** & **SAPD** is applications are not always available and tend to alert players via the **FDG Government discord** when applications are open. 

You can join that discord by following this link - https://discord.gg/jFBgaWt
